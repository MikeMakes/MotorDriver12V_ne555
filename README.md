# MotorDriver12V_ne555
A messy 12v motor driver made with a ne555 which conmute a transistor to generate a +12V pwm.
I did this for an emergency, so I dont think I will finish it.

There were a pcb made and the components values were anotated in the sch. Not anymore. I will upload them in case I find them.

# TODOs
-The frequwncy used for the pwm is audible (~50hz i believe) so it would be nice to change this
